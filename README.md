🚀 Exciting Update on My BUZZED Project! 🍹

I’m thrilled to share that I’ve been enhancing my BUZZED project, which focuses on drinks! Until now, it was a front-end experience built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I’m now adding the back-end using PHP and MySQL. 💻

Here’s what I’ve been working on:

Database Integration: It’s now possible to add drinks directly to the database, making the app more dynamic and interactive.

Form Handling: Through PHP, I’m managing form data and inserting it into the database.

In the video below, you can see the process in action! I added a Margarita drink to the catalog, showing how it gets added to the database in real-time. At the end, I showcase the code behind this functionality.

It’s been an incredible learning experience, and I’m excited to continue growing this project!
